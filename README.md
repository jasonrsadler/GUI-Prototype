# GUI-Prototype
This is a Unity prototype to showcase POC GUI iterating a list of 3D objects

This is a simple list of objects that can be edited at design time through the ACA menu. The objects are stored as a List at runtime and the user is able to cycle through the items.

Also, a mock logon is prototyped. The logon ID is simply 'admin' with any or no password. There really isn't anything on the backend that connects this to any type of security. Only a string match on the logon ID is performed.

The chair and chest assets are from the Unity Store and the bumper asset was created in Blender.
